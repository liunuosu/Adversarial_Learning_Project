Project implementing adversarial learning as proposed by 
Zhang et al - Mitigating biases in adversaria learning.

The project replicates and extends on the methodology.
First, we explore the use of a validation set.
Second, we substitute the structure of the adversary with a general hidden layer NN
Third, the use of multiple adversaries in the debiasing of multiple sensitive features
